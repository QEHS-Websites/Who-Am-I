## "Who am I" Project Main Sections
For additional details, see Rubric and Expectations below

**Pieces of this section create routine for validating and verifying webpages**

Case Study: minimum is an 11x17 with a box illustrating layout and descriptions around explaining content
- Note: 2 pieces of paper might be easier to work with
  - 1 piece of paper for content (word lists, actual text, and ideas for images, videos, audio, and other media)
  - 1 piece of paper for layout

Creating a GitHub Repository for this Project, learning how to save URLs (& date accessed) with actual files
   - Create basic repository: <a href="https://github.com/MercersKitchen/Computer-Science-Planning/tree/master/Projects/Creating%20a%20GitHub%20Repository">see Creating a GitHub Repository</a>
   - Create the main page called index.html (needed for GitHub Hosting), create a new `*.txt` document and rename it
   - Add basic boilerplate (typing html in empty .html through WYSIWYG)
   - Reminder: eventually Web DOCs will be saved here
     - Note: saving the URL into the REadMe.md file is less memory than saving the downloaded file
     - CAUTION: if the owner of the image takes it away, it will no longer be on your webpage
     - Solution: prioritize downloaded pieces and only save the ones you _really_ need
     - Alternate Solution: create a Google Drive Folder and copy URL to point webpage to

Create a To Do List in the ReadMe.md
   - Rewrite the case study into a sequence of items to do
   - Items must be in hierarchy, per element or feature: Order of Scroll should match reading a webpage "top to bottom" and "left to right"
   - Must submit Case Study, Must submit GitHub Link
   - Reminders
     - GitHub link to Markdown Review: <a href="https://github.com/MercersKitchen/Markdown-ReadMe-Documentation">Click Here</a>

Reinterpret Case Study into Scrollable Webpage HTML DOC
   - Add additional boilerplate to reimage webpage
   - Reminder: individual elements or features, that should be "left to right" will be that way after CSS Lessons

Setting up the Chrome Browser for HTML & CSS Validation
   a. HTML Validation
      - In Workona, point a TAB to https://validator.w3.org/
      - Able to validate hosted and local documents
   b. CSS Validation
      - In Workona, point a TAB to https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator.html.en
      - Able to validate hosted and local documents
   c. Accessibility Testing as a Chrome Developer Tool
      - In the Chrome Store, search for "aXe, Deque Systems" and add it to Chrome
      - In Chrome/Extensions Settings, allow aXe to access URLs
      - Able to find this in Developer Tools and the Analyze Button
